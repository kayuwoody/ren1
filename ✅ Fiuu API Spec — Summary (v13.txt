✅ Fiuu API Spec — Summary (v13.90, Jun 2025)
________________


🔄 Core Payment Flow (High-Level)
1. Merchant → Fiuu

   * POST/GET request redirects customer to Fiuu’s hosted payment page.

   * Requests encrypted (vcode).

      2. Customer pays

         * Banking login / e-wallet / QR / card, etc.

            3. Fiuu → Merchant

               * Fiuu sends transaction result via:

                  * Return URL (browser redirect) — unreliable

                  * Notification URL (webhook) — reliable

                  * Callback URL (delayed updates) — for non-realtime payments

                     4. Merchant → Fiuu (optional)

                        * Merchant can requery status to confirm anything that looks off.

🔐 Security
Keys
Key
	Purpose
	Who Uses It
	Verify Key
	Generates request hash (vcode)
	Merchant
	Secret Key
	Verifies response hash (skey)
	Merchant
	Hashes
                           * vcode = MD5 hash for outbound payment request

                           * skey = MD5 hash for inbound payment response (double-hashed)

These ensure nobody hijacks your request and reroutes grandma’s grocery payment to buy a PS5.

🌐 Required Endpoints & Domain Rules
Must register your webhook domains at the portal — otherwise status notifications might never reach you.
Endpoints to handle:
                              1. Return URL (front-end redirect)

                              2. Notification URL (server-to-server reliable)

                              3. Callback URL (deferred statuses)

🧪 Testing Accounts
Fiuu offers:
                                 * Sandbox account — simple testing

                                 * Developer account — full-feature UAT; not eligible for settlement

All “_Dev” accounts never payout. (Don’t ask why your money never shows up.)

📬 Result Handling & IPN
Fiuu provides three possible streams for payment results:
Channel
	Nature
	Reliability
	Return URL
	Browser redirect
	Unreliable
	Notification URL
	Webhook
	Best
	Callback URL
	Delayed change
	Special cases
	Best practice:
✅ Use Notification URL
⚠ Return URL only for UI
📌 Keep Callback URL to catch late updates

⭐ Quick Implementation Reality Check
If you integrate:
                                                   * Hosted Page only: Simple. Just redirect + validate hash.

                                                   * Webhooks: Necessary for reliability.

                                                   * Requery API: Use for sanity checks.

                                                   * Tokenization/Recurring: Supported.
